# To add  or modify global environment variables please modify in '~/.config/uwsm/env.d/*.sh' files.
# Create a new file: ~/.config/uwsm/env.d/my_env.sh
# This is used to set environment variables that should be available globally in your user land.

# For users who still want the environment variables but DON'T want to use uwsm, please manually source the files yourself.
# take note uwsm accepts POSIX shell syntax, so you can use it in your own shell that are POSIX compliant.
