# Dotfiles!

## About

This repo is the place to save all my config files for bspwm on archlinux and other things I may find useful.

There's a shell scripting for copying these configs to their right place, but it's a little rough, so use it with care (or just modify it to fit your style).

The files here are personal config and sometimes they have my username on them (I'm not modifying this right now). If you're interested in using the script and the files, just change the username on the files later.
